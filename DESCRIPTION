Description: What the package does (one paragraph). This package implements asymmetric portfolio optimization using mean-weighted variance (and co-variance) methodology. Users can identify a theoretically efficient frontier based on their prefered performance (growth) target and risk tolerance (including only upside or downside semi-variance models). The package will also identify the composition of frontier portfolios across the range of possible return/risk.
